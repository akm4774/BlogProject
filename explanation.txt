Explanation of Blog Project

This project is a simple blog application built with Django, which allows users to create, edit, delete blogs, and manage their account profiles. Here are the main features of the project:

Features

1. Sign Up / Login (Authentication Forms using User Model Django)
   - Sign Up: Users can register for a new account by providing a username, email address, and password. The sign-up form includes validation to ensure that usernames are alphanumeric, do not contain numbers, and are unique. Similarly, the email address must be unique.
   - Login: Registered users can log in to the application using their username and password. The login form ensures secure authentication before granting access to user-specific features.

2. Create, Edit, Delete Blogs (Created by the Same User)
   - Create Blog: Authenticated users can create new blog posts by providing a title and content. The blog will be associated with the user who created it.
   - Edit Blog: Users can edit their own blog posts. They can update the title and content of the blog.
   - Delete Blog: Users can delete their own blog posts, permanently removing them from the application.

3. Update, Edit, Delete Account/Profile
   - Update Profile: Users can update their profile information, including uploading a profile image. The profile is linked to the user's account.
   - Edit Account: Users can edit their account details such as username and email address.
   - Delete Account: Users can delete their account, which will also delete all the blogs and profile information associated with their account.

4. View Blogs via Dashboard (Even When Not Logged In)
   - View Blogs: All users, including those who are not logged in, can view blog posts. The dashboard displays a list of all blog posts, including titles and truncated content, allowing visitors to read blogs without requiring an account.

Users

The application has two pre-created users for demonstration purposes:

- Username: akshay
  - Password: randomuser12

- Username: vanshika
  - Password: newuser32

These users can be used to explore the functionalities of the application, including creating, editing, and deleting blogs, as well as managing their account profiles.
